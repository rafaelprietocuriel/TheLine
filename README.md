# TheLine
Code to simulate mobility in The Line based on origin and destinations and a train line
We assume that a person lives in position x, that is only the coordinate of their house, with x in (0, 170) in km. They want to visit a destination, with location y also in (0, 170). 

We take random pairs and measure the time it takes in the person walks, or if they take the train, and if there is a second line, if they use it.

We report the corresponding intervals after simulating the same process thousands of times.
